# include:                    you can turn a model on or off by setting include: 1 or include: 0, respectively
# pole_nx                     number of poles aligned with the x-axis
# pole_ny                     number of poles aligned with the y-axis (keep fixed at pole_ny: 5, if you want the canopy to fit)
# pole_dx                     distance between poles aligned with the x-axis (meters)
# pole_dy                     distance between poles aligned with the y-axis (meters) (keep fixed at pole_dy: 1.35, if you want the canopy to fit)
# pole_xoffset                sets the position of the poles along the x-axis (meters)
# pole_yoffset                sets the position of the poles along the y-axis (meters)
# arch_nx                     number of arches 
# arch_dx                     distance between arches (meters)
# arch_xoffset                sets the position of the arches along the x-axis (meters)

# note: if you don't want the polytunnel to have a canopy set arch_nx: 0
# note: if you change the world name you will also have to change it in the launch file ../launch/thorvald_world_AB.launch (or make another launch file).
