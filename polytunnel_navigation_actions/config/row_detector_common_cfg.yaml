eps: 0.15                  # Parameter of DBSCAN clustering algorithm. The maximum distance (meters) between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other.        
min_samples_dbscan: 2      # Parameter of DBSCAN clustering algorithm. The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point.
